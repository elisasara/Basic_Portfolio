            <p>Hello from the City of Brotherly Love! I currently work as the Director of Annual Giving for a non-profit social services agency, Jewish Family and Children's Service of Greater Philadelphia. Additonally, I'm enrolled in a part-time coding bootcamp through the University of Pennsylvania. My interest in coding began when I was tasked with creating new and innovative ways to motivate donors to give online. My goal is to begin a new career in the technology sector by combining the project management skills I have gained through my current career with the technical skills I am learning now. One of the things I enjoy most about web development is the collaborative and creative environment surrounding each project and that is what I'm looking forward to most in this career change.</p>
            <p>A few fun facts about me include that I am a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan, I love animals, and am a bit of a nerd at heart.</p>
